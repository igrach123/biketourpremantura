                     <strong> Windsurfing Center Premantura </strong>  Premantura was founded in 2000.
                    The Center, which started as a windsurfing school and bicycle rental spot, has not stopped developing since its beginning. Over the years, we have developed into a windsurfing center which is well stocked with both school and rental boards. Likewise, from the initial 6, we now rent more than 100 mountain bikes of various dimensions and quality. In time, we have expanded our services which now also include sea kayaks and stand up paddle boards for rent. 
                        <span id="hiddenText">
                  We have about thirty kayaks and a dozen stand up paddle boards.
                We also offer organized mountain bike and sea kayak   excursions. We offer several options, from excursions with large groups for over 15 participants to special excursions for up to 6 persons. 
                The staff of our Center are qualified and well experienced in performing of all the activities that our Center offers.
                Our centers are located in Premantura at the ArenaStupiceCampite and in Medulin at the Arena Medulin Campsite.
